From my nerdly listenings while cooking last night:

The first episode of [Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots](http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/1) (Ben Orenstein's Thoughtbot podcast) from nigh on two years ago has some brief but good discussion of using polymorphism in place of conditional logic and of null objects. I've been trying to get my head around those two patterns in hopes they'll help me unsnarl some complex legacy code.

I also got around to re-listening to [Back to Work #47](http://5by5.tv/b2w/47) from just before new year's eve 2011, one of that show's strongest installments, in which Merlin Mann breaks out some reasons why new year's resolutions don't work and suggests alternatives that feed into the concept of building habits rather than setting goals.
